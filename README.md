Problem 1
=========

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Problem 2
=========

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of
the numbers from 1 to 20?

Answer: bc0d0a22a7a46212135ed0ba77d22f3a

Problem 6
=========

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

    1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Problem 9
=========

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for
which,

    a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.

The product of these numbers is 26 × 63 × 78 × 14 = 1788696.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same
direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20×20 grid?

Answer: 678f5d2e1eaa42f04fa53411b4f441ac


Problem 12
==========

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 =  28. 

The first ten terms would be:

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

     1: 1
     3: 1,3
     6: 1,2,3,6
    10: 1,2,5,10
    15: 1,3,5,15
    21: 1,3,7,21
    28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five
divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
divisors?

Problem 14
==========


The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive
integers:

    n → n/2 (n is even)
    n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
sequence:

    13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet ([Collatz Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)),
it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than
n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable pair
and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,
2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Problem 23
==========

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors
of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect
number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is
24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However,
this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it
is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of
two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the
sum of two abundant numbers.

divisible by 41.

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can
be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

    9 = 7 + 2×1²
    15 = 7 + 2×2²
    21 = 3 + 2×3²
    25 = 7 + 2×3²
    27 = 19 + 2×2²
    33 = 31 + 2×1²

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a
prime and twice a square?

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms
increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are
prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one
another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit
primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit
increasing sequence.

By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that
six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all
prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this
5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten
generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663,
56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this

Problem 54
==========

In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from
lowest to highest, in the following way:

* High Card: Highest value card.
* One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
* Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
* Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
* Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
* Flush: All cards of the same suit.
* Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
* Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
* Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
* Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.

The cards are valued in the order:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the
highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives
(see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players
have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see
example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are
compared, and so on.

Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

    Hand   Player 1            Player 2              Winner
    1      5H 5C 6S 7S KD      2C 3S 8S 8D TD        Player 2

           Full House          Full House            Player 1
           With Three Fours    with Three Threes

The file, [poker.txt](files/poker.txt), contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two
players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single
space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player
2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters
or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in
each hand there is a clear winner.

How many hands does Player 1 win?

Problem 55
==========

If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.

Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

    349 + 943 = 1292,
    1292 + 2921 = 4213
    4213 + 3124 = 7337

That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.

Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like
196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome
through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the
theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem,
we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In
addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will
either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no
one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map
it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to
require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome:
4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).

Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel
numbers; the first example is 4994.

How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?

NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the
theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an
infinite continued fraction.

    √ 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

    1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
    1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
    1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
    1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...

The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth

Problem 59
==========

Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred
standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).
For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.

A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to
ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The
advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on
the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107,
then 107 XOR 42 = 65.

For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and
without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.

Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the
message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the
message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password
key for security, but short enough to be memorable.

Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three
lower case characters. Using [cipher1.txt](files/cipher1.txt), a file containing the
encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain
common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII
values in the original text.

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can
be written in the form:

```
√N = a[0] +  ___________1___________
              a[1] + _______1_______
                     a[2] + ____1___
                            a[3] + …
```

For example, let us consider √23:

```
√23 = 4 + √23 — 4 = 4 + ___1___ = 4 +  ______1______
						 __1__         1 + _√23 – 3_
						 √23—4                 7
```

If we continue we would get the following expansion:

```
√23 = 4 +  _________1__________
		   1 + ______ 1________
                3 + _____1______
                    1 + ___1____
                          8 + …
```

The process can be summarised as follows:

    a[0] = 4,   __1__ = _√23+4_   = 1 + _√23—3_
                √23—4      7               7
    a[1] = 1,   __7__  = _7(√23+3)_ = 3 + _√23—3_
                √23—3        14              2
    a[2] = 3,   __2__  = _2(√23+3)_ = 1 + _√23—4_
                √23—3        14              7
    a[3] = 1,   __7__  = _7(√23+4)_ = 8 + √23—4
                √23—4        7
    a[4] = 8,   __1__ = _√23+4_   = 1 + _√23—3_
                √23—4      7               7
    a[5] = 1,   __7__  = _7(√23+3)_ = 3 + _√23—3_
                √23—3        14              2
    a[6] = 3,   __2__  = _2(√23+3)_ = 1 + _√23—4_

    a[7] = 1,   __7__  = _7(√23+4)_ = 8 + √23—4
                √23—4        7

It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the
notation √23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)], to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats
indefinitely.

The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square

The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
   
```
   √2 = 1 + _________1________

                    2 + ___1__
                        2 + …
```

The infinite continued fraction can be written, √2 = [1;(2)], (2)
indicates that 2 repeats ad infinitum. In a similar way, √23 =
[4;(1,3,1,8)].

It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions
for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider
the convergents for √2.

```
1 + _1_ = 3/2
     2  

1 + __1__ = 7/5
    2 +_1_
        2  

1 + ____1____ = 17/12
    2 + __1__  
        2 +_1_
            2  

1 + ______1______ = 41/29
    2 + ____1____
        2 + __1__  
            2 +_1_ 
                2

Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for √2 are:

    1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, …

What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
    e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2k,1, ...].

The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:

    2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, ...

The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10^th convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form: x² – Dy² = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649² – 13×180² = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D
is square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the
following:

    2² – 3×1² = 1
    9² – 5×4² = 1
    5² – 6×2² = 1

obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest

Euler's Totient function, φ(n) (sometimes called the phi function), is
used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively
prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine
and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.

| n   | Relatively Prime | φ(n) | n/φ(n) |

The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the
factorial of its digits is equal to 145:

1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of
numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such
loops that exist:

    169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169
    871 → 45361 → 871
    872 → 45362 → 872

It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually
get stuck in a loop. For example,

    69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)
    78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)
    540 → 145 (→ 145)

In the game, Monopoly, the standard board is set up in the following way:

    GO   A1  CC1  A2  T1  R1  B1  CH1  B2   B3  JAIL
    H2                                          C1
    T2                                          U1
    H1                                          C2
    CH3                                         C3
    R4                                          R2
    G3                                          D1
    CC3                                         CC2

    G1                                          D3
    G2J  F3  U2   F2  F1  R3  E3  E2   CH2  E1  FP

A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice
to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction.
Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal
probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community
chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.

In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the
player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive
doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they
proceed directly to jail.

At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a
player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective
pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom
of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of
this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any
instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player
will remain on the CC/CH square.

Community Chest (2/16 cards):

1. Advance to GO
2. Go to JAIL

Chance (10/16 cards):

1. Advance to GO
2. Go to JAIL
3. Go to C1
4. Go to E3
5. Go to H2
6. Go to R1
7. Go to next R (railway company)
8. Go to next R
9. Go to next U (utility company)
10. Go back 3 squares.

The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular
square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll.
For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for
which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have
the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and
it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we
are interested in. We shall make no distinction between "Just Visiting"
and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring
a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they pay to get out on their
next turn.

By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we
can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond
with sets of squares.

Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in
order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO
(3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed
with the six-digit modal string: 102400.

If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the
six-digit modal string.

A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given
set of at least two natural numbers, {a[1], a[2], ... , a[k]} is called a
product-sum number: N = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[k] = a[1] × a[2] × ... × a[k].

For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.

For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this
property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for
sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.

    k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2
    k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3
    k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4
    k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2
    k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6

Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is
4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.

In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12 is

What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12000?

Problem 90
==========

Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on
it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes
side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit
numbers.

For example, the square number 64 could be formed:

![](files/p_090.gif)

In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to
display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25,
36, 49, 64, and 81.

For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.

However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned
upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3,
4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it
would be impossible to obtain 09.

In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on
each cube, not the order.

* {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
* {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}

But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets
in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.

square numbers to be displayed?

Problem 93
==========


By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and
making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and
brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer
targets.

For example,

    8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
    14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
    19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1
    36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)

Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.

Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different

Problem 94
==========

It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral
length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle
5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.

We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which
two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with
integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one
billion (1,000,000,000).

Problem 95
==========

The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number
itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As
the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.

Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of
the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For
this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.

Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with
12496, we form a chain of five numbers:

     12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...)

Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable
chain.

Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element
exceeding one million.

Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular
puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to
Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle
idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is
to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row,
column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an
example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved
by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods
in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this).
The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the
example above is considered easy because it can be solved by straight
forward direct deduction.

The 6K text file, [sudoku.txt](files/sudoku.txt), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles
ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in
the file is the example above).

By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in
the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit
number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.

By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6
respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36^2. What is remarkable is
that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also
forms a square number: 9216 = 96^2. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square
anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not
permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as
another letter.

Problem 101
===========

If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible
to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely
many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.

As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is
defined by the generating function,
u[n] = n^3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...

Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working
on the principle that "simple is best" we should assume a linear
relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7).
Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same
principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.

We shall define OP(k, n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial
generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be
clear that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for
n ≤ k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k, k+1);
in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).

As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be
most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n ≥ 2, OP(1, n) = u[1].

Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:

    OP(1, n) = 1               1,[1], 1, 1, ...
    OP(2, n) = 7n−6            1, 8, [15], ...
    OP(3, n) = 6n^2−11n+6      1, 8, 27, [58], ...
    OP(4, n) = n^3             1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...

Clearly no BOPs exist for k ≥ 4.

By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in brackets above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.

Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:

   u[n] = 1 − n + n^2 − n^3 + n^4 − n^5 + n^6 − n^7 + n^8 − n^9 + n^10

Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.

Problem 103
===========

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call
it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C,
the following properties are true:

i. S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
ii. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special
sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.

```
n = 1: {1}
n = 2: {1, 2}
n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}
```

It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a[1], a[2], ... , a[n]}, the
next optimum set is of the form B = {b, a[1]+b, a[2]+b, ... ,a[n]+b},
where b is the "middle" element on the previous row.

By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be A
= {11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the
optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near
optimum set. The optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25},
with S(A) = 115 and corresponding set string: 111819202225.

Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.

   the following properties are true:

   i. S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
   ii. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

   For example, {81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65} is not a special sum set
   because 65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84, whereas {157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159,
   161, 139, 158} satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair
   combinations and S(A) = 1286.

ii. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly
increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained
from a set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for
equality (first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966

Problem 109
===========

In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which
is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.

![](files/p_109.gif)

The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the
dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores
zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single
scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and
treble scores respectively.

At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull
region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull
is a double, worth 50 points.

There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the
players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce
their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a
"doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double
(including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final
dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one
or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust".

When a player is able to finish on their current score it is called a
"checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s
and double bull).

There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:

							   ┌──┬──┬──┐
							   │D3│  │  │
							   ├──┼──┼──┤
							   │D1│D2│  │

							   │D1│S2│D1│
							   ├──┼──┼──┤
							   │S2│S2│D1│
							   └──┴──┴──┘

Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on
different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the
same as T1 S1 D1.

In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for
example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.

Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.

How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?

Answer: 591a7a92f10322866e6a02f3b2386a1c

Problem 111
===========

Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that
they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by
22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:

		  1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111

We shall say that M(n, d) represents the maximum number of repeated digits
for an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n, d) represents the
number of such primes, and S(n, d) represents the sum of these primes.

So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit
prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes,
and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for d =
0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are
N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.

In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.
   
| Digit, d | M(4, d) | N(4, d) | S(4,d) |
| -------- | --------| ------- | ------ |
| 0        | 2       | 13      | 67061  |
| 1        | 3       | 9       | 22275  |
| 2        | 3       | 1       | 2221   |
| 3        | 3       | 12      | 46214  |
| 4        | 3       | 2       | 8888   |
| 5        | 3       | 1       | 5557   |
| 6        | 3       | 1       | 6661   |
| 7        | 3       | 9       | 57863  |
| 8        | 3       | 1       | 8887   |
| 9        | 3       | 7       | 48073  |

For d = 0 to 9, the sum of all S(4, d) is 273700.

Problem 112
===========


   Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
   left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

   Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a
   decreasing number; for example, 66420.

   We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing
   a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

   Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just
   over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the
   least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50%

Problem 113
===========


   Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
   left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

   Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a
   decreasing number; for example, 66420.

   We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing
   a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

   As n increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such
   that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy
   and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 10^10.

   How many numbers below a googol (10^100) are not bouncy?

   How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled?

   NOTE: Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility,

Problem 115
===========

NOTE: This is a more difficult version of [Problem 114](#problem-114).

A row measuring n units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of
m units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to
be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.

Let the fill-count function, F(m, n), represent the number of ways that a
row can be filled.

For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.

That is, for m = 3, it can be seen that n = 30 is the smallest value for
which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

In the same way, for m = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711
and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so n = 57 is the least value for which the
fill-count function first exceeds one million.

For m = 50, find the least value of n for which the fill-count function
first exceeds one million.

   We shall define a[n] to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that a

Problem 121
===========


   A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc. In a game of chance a
   player takes a disc at random and its colour is noted. After each turn the
   disc is returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and another disc
   is taken at random.

   The player pays £1 to play and wins if they have taken more blue discs
   than red discs at the end of the game.

   If the game is played for four turns, the probability of a player winning
   is exactly 11/120, and so the maximum prize fund the banker should
   allocate for winning in this game would be £10 before they would expect to
   incur a loss. Note that any payout will be a whole number of pounds and
   also includes the original £1 paid to play the game, so in the example
   given the player actually wins £9.

   Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game in
   which fifteen turns are played.

   The most naive way of computing n^15 requires fourteen multiplications:

   n × n × ... × n = n^15

   But using a "binary" method you can compute it in six multiplications:

   n × n = n^2
   n^2 × n^2 = n^4
   n^4 × n^4 = n^8
   n^8 × n^4 = n^12
   n^12 × n^2 = n^14
   n^14 × n = n^15

   However it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications:

   n × n = n^2
   n^2 × n = n^3
   n^3 × n^3 = n^6
   n^6 × n^6 = n^12
   n^12 × n^3 = n^15

   We shall define m(k) to be the minimum number of multiplications to
   compute n^k; for example m(15) = 5.

   For 1 ≤ k ≤ 200, find ∑ m(k).

   The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of the distinct prime factors of
   n. For example, 504 = 2^3 × 3^2 × 7, so rad(504) = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.

   If we calculate rad(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, then sort them on rad(n), and
   sorting on n if the radical values are equal, we get:

   There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be

===========

The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid
measuring 3 x 2 x 1 is twenty-two.

![](files/p_126.gif)

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six
cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require
seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and
eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.

However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 x 1 x 1 also requires
twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring
5 x 3 x 1, 7 x 2 x 1, and 11 x 1 x 1 all contain forty-six cubes.

We shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain n
cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118)
= 8.

It turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.

   The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of distinct prime factors of n.
   For example, 504 = 2^3 × 3^2 × 7, so rad(504) = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.

   We shall define the triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an
   abc-hit if:

    1. GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, c) = GCD(b, c) = 1
    2. a < b
    3. a + b = c
    4. rad(abc) < c

   For example, (5, 27, 32) is an abc-hit, because:

    1. GCD(5, 27) = GCD(5, 32) = GCD(27, 32) = 1
    2. 5 < 27
    3. 5 + 27 = 32
    4. rad(4320) = 30 < 32

   It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one
   abc-hits for c < 1000, with ∑c = 12523.

   Find ∑c for c < 120000.

A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal
tiles, starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an
anti-clockwise direction.

New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being
numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. The diagram below shows
the first three rings.

![](files/p_128.gif)

By finding the difference between tile n and each its six neighbours we
shall define PD(n) to be the number of those differences which are prime.

For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29,
11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.

In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and
10, hence PD(17) = 2.

It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(n) is 3.

If all of the tiles for which PD(n) = 3 are listed in ascending order to
form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.

Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.

Problem 138
===========

Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs, L =
17.

![](files/p_138.gif)

By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the
triangle, h = √(17^2 − 8^2) = 15, which is one less than the base length.

With b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the base
length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the
property that h = b ± 1.

Find ∑ L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h = b ± 1
and b, L are positive integers.

Problem 139
===========

Let (a, b, c) represent the three sides of a right angle triangle with
integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles
together to form a square with length c.

For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5
square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5
square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.

![](files/p_139.gif)

However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure 7
by 7 and these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.

Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred
million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to take
place?

Consider the infinite polynomial series `A[G](x) = xG[1] + x^2G[2] +

relation G[k] = G[k−1] + G[k−2], G[1] = 1 and G[2] = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5,
9, 14, 23, ... .

For this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which `A[G](x)`
is a positive integer.

The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown
below.

| (√137−5)/14 | 4         |
| 1/2         | 5         |

We shall call `A[G](x)` a golden nugget if x is rational, because they
become increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is
211345365.

Problem 141
===========


   A positive integer, n, is divided by d and the quotient and remainder are
   q and r respectively. In addition d, q, and r are consecutive positive
   integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.

   For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient 9 and remainder 4. It can also
   be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common
   ratio 3/2).
   We will call such numbers, n, progressive.

   Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 102^2, happen to also be
   perfect squares.
   The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is
   124657.

Problem 143
===========


Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120
degrees. Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA = p, XC = q,
and XB = r.

Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p + q + r
was minimised.

Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and
AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed
circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside
the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat
point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that
when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN, BM and CO
also intersect at T.

![](files/p_143_torricelli.gif)

If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive integers
we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle. For example, a = 399, b
= 455, c = 511 is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with p + q + r =
784.

Find the sum of all distinct values of p + q + r ≤ 120000 for Torricelli
triangles.

Problem 144
===========


In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay
line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the
mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.

The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the
equation 4x^2 + y^2 = 100

![](files/p_144_1.gif) ![](files/p_144_2.gif)

The section corresponding to −0.01 ≤ x ≤ +0.01 at the top is missing,
allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside
the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6).

Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the
usual law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of reflection."
That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with
the normal line at the point of incidence.

In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of
contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue
line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of
the first bounce.

The slope m of the tangent line at any point (x,y) of the given ellipse
is: m = −4x/y

The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of
incidence.

The animation on the right shows the first 10 reflections of the beam.

How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell
before exiting?

   Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale:

   First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form
   of what is known as a "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":

   For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, s[k] = [100003 − 200003k + 300007k^3] (modulo 1000000) −
   500000.
   For 56 ≤ k ≤ 4000000, s[k] = [s[k−24] + s[k−55] + 1000000] (modulo
   1000000) − 500000.

   Thus, s[10] = −393027 and s[100] = 86613.

   The terms of s are then arranged in a 2000×2000 table, using the first
   2000 numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next 2000 numbers
   to fill the second row, and so on.

   Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any
   direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).

Problem 150
===========

In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a
sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest
possible.

In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle
satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.

![](files/p_150.gif)

We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we
generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers s[k] in the range ±2^19, using a
type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator)
as follows:

t := 0
for k = 1 up to k = 500500:
    t := (615949*t + 797807) modulo 2^20
    s[k] := t−2^19

Thus: s[1] = 273519, s[2] = −153582, s[3] = 450905 etc

Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:

								  s[1]
							   s[2]  s[3]
						   s[4]  s[5]  s[6] 
						s[7]  s[8]  s[9]  s[10]
								  ...

Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as far
as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the next
row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and so
on).
The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements it
contains.
Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.

A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires
a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.

Every Monday morning, the foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large
sheet of the special paper with size A1.

He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then he
cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until he
obtains the A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week.

All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

![](files/p_151.gif)

At the beginning of each subsequent batch, he takes from the envelope one
sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, he uses it. If it is
larger, he repeats the 'cut-in-half' procedure until he has what he needs
and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.

Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number
of times (during each week) that the foreman finds a single sheet of paper
in the envelope.

Problem 153
===========

As we all know the equation x^2=-1 has no solutions for real x.
If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two
solutions: x=i and x=-i.
If we go a step further the equation (x-3)^2=-4 has two complex solutions:
x=3+2i and x=3-2i.
x=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others' complex conjugate.
Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.
In general a+bi and a−bi are each other's complex conjugate.

A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are
integers.
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b ≠ 0 we call such
integers "rational integers."
A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the
result is also a Gaussian integer.
If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify ![](files/p_153_formule1.gif) in the following
manner:
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1−2i.
The result is ![](files/p_153_formule2.gif).
So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.
Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because ![](files/p_153_formule5.gif).
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational
integer n, then its complex conjugate (a−bi) is also a divisor of n.

In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 +
2i, 1 − 2i, 2 + i, 2 − i, 5}.
The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five
positive rational integers:

|  n  | Gaussian integer divisors with positive real part | Sum s(n) of these divisors |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | 1                                                 | 1                          |
| 2   | 1, 1+i, 1-i, 2                                    | 5                          |
| 3   | 1, 3                                              | 4                          |
| 4   | 1, 1+i, 1-i, 2, 2+2i, 2-2i, 4                     | 13                         |
| 5   | 1, 1+2i, 1-2i, 2+i, 2-i, 5                        | 12                         |

A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each
ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.

Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each

A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three
spheres directly below the current position.

Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum
of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are
up to three numbers above it).

The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the

An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same
value C.
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form
sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other
capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a
final circuit.

Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make
circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example,
using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 μF each, we can obtain the following 7
distinct total capacitance values:

![](files/p_155_capacitors1.gif)

If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we
can obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple
procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...

Find D(18).

===========


Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base 10 like
this: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ….

Consider the digit d=1. After we write down each number n, we will update
the number of ones that have occurred and call this number f(n,1). The
first values for f(n,1), then, are as follows:

| n   | f(n,1) |
| --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0      |
| 1   | 1      |
| 2   | 1      |

| 9   | 1      |
| 10  | 2      |
| 11  | 4      |
| 12  | 5      |

Note that f(n,1) never equals 3.
So the first two solutions of the equation f(n,1)=n are n=0 and n=1. The
next solution is n=199981.

In the same manner the function f(n,d) gives the total number of digits d
that have been written down after the number n has been written.
In fact, for every digit d ≠ 0, 0 is the first solution of the equation
f(n,d)=n.

Let s(d) be the sum of all the solutions for which f(n,d)=n.
You are given that s(1)=22786974071.

Find ∑ s(d) for 1 ≤ d ≤ 9.

Note: if, for some n, f(n,d)=n for more than one value of d this value of
n is counted again for every value of d for which f(n,d)=n.

   For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically
   after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters that
   come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
   In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character
   comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.

   We now consider strings of n ≤ 26 different characters from the alphabet.
   For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly
   one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.

   What is the maximum value of p(n)?

Problem 159
===========

A composite number can be factored many different ways. For instance, not
including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:

    24 = 2x2x2x3
    24 = 2x3x4
    24 = 2x2x6
    24 = 4x6
    24 = 3x8
    24 = 2x12
    24 = 24

Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding
together the digits of that number, and repeating that process until a
number is arrived at that is less than 10. Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.

We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the
individual factors of our number.
The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.
   
| Factorisation | Digital Root Sum |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| 2x2x2x3       | 9                |
| 2x3x4         | 9                |
| 2x2x6         | 10               |
| 4x6           | 10               |
| 3x8           | 11               |
| 2x12          | 5                |
| 24            | 6                |

The maximum Digital Root Sum of 24 is 11.
The function mdrs(n) gives the maximum Digital Root Sum of n. So
mdrs(24)=11.
Find ∑mdrs(n) for 1 < n < 1,000,000.

Problem 163
===========

Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from
each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the size 1
triangle in the sketch below.

![](files/p_163.gif)

Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or
location can now be observed in that triangle. Using size 1 triangles as
building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the size 2
triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either
different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in
that size 2 triangle.

It can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle
building blocks. A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle
building blocks and a size n triangle would thus contain n^2 size 1
triangle building blocks.

If we denote T(n) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size
n, then

T(1) = 16
T(2) = 104

Find T(36).

Problem 165
===========


   A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.
   By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three
   possibilities:
   the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in
   common.

   Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be
   the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the
   segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint
   of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.
   We will call a common point T of two segments L[1] and L[2] a true
   intersection point of L[1] and L[2] if T is the only common point of L[1]
   and L[2] and T is an interior point of both segments.

   Consider the three segments L[1], L[2], and L[3]:

   L[1]: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
   L[2]: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
   L[3]: (46, 70) to (22, 40)

   It can be verified that line segments L[2] and L[3] have a true
   intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of L[3]:
   (22,40) lies on L[1] this is not considered to be a true point of
   intersection. L[1] and L[2] have no common point. So among the three line
   segments, we find one true intersection point.

   Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate
   20000 numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number
   generator.

   s[0] = 290797

   s[n+1] = s[n]×s[n] (modulo 50515093)

   t[n] = s[n] (modulo 500)

   To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers t[n]. That
   is, the first line segment is given by:

   (t[1], t[2]) to (t[3], t[4])

   The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should
   be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to
   (12,232).

   How many distinct true intersection points are found among the 5000 line
   segments?

   The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:

   Generate two distinct primes p and q.
   Compute n=pq and φ=(p-1)(q-1).
   Find an integer e, 1<e<φ, such that gcd(e,φ)=1.

   A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,n-1].
   A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in
   the interval [0,n-1]).
   To encrypt the text, for each message, m, c=m^e mod n is calculated.

   To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate d such
   that ed=1 mod φ, then for each encrypted message, c, calculate m=c^d mod
   n.

   There exist values of e and m such that m^e mod n=m.
   We call messages m for which m^e mod n=m unconcealed messages.

   An issue when choosing e is that there should not be too many unconcealed
   messages.
   For instance, let p=19 and q=37.
   Then n=19*37=703 and φ=18*36=648.
   If we choose e=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all
   possible messages
   m (0≤m≤n-1) are unconcealed when calculating m^e mod n.
   For any valid choice of e there exist some unconcealed messages.
   It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.

   Choose p=1009 and q=3643.
   Find the sum of all values of e, 1<e<φ(1009,3643) and gcd(e,φ)=1, so that
   the number of unconcealed messages for this value of e is at a minimum.

   Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into k equal parts, r =
   N/k, so that N = r + r + ... + r.
   Let P be the product of these parts, P = r × r × ... × r = r^k.

   For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 +
   2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.2^5 = 51.53632.

   Let M(N) = P[max] for a given value of N.

   It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into
   four equal parts which leads to P[max] = (11/4)^4; that is, M(11) =
   14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.

   However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three
   equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.

   Let D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N) is
   a terminating decimal.

   For example, ΣD(N) for 5 ≤ N ≤ 100 is 2438.

   Find ΣD(N) for 5 ≤ N ≤ 10000.

The game Number Mind is a variant of the well known game Master Mind.

Instead of coloured pegs, you have to guess a secret sequence of digits.
After each guess you're only told in how many places you've guessed the
correct digit. So, if the sequence was 1234 and you guessed 2036, you'd be
told that you have one correct digit; however, you would NOT be told that
you also have another digit in the wrong place.

For instance, given the following guesses for a 5-digit secret sequence,

    90342 ;2 correct
    70794 ;0 correct
    39458 ;2 correct
    34109 ;1 correct
    51545 ;2 correct
    12531 ;1 correct

Problem 186
===========


Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million users:

| RecNr | Caller   | Called  |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 1     | 200007   | 100053  |
| 2     | 600183   | 500439  |
| 3     | 600863   | 701497  |
| …     | …        | …       |

The telephone number of the caller and the called number in record n are
Caller(n) = S[2n-1] and Called(n) = S[2n] where S[1,2,3,...] come from the
"Lagged Fibonacci Generator":

For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, S[k] = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k^3] (modulo 1000000)
For 56 ≤ k, S[k] = [S[k-24] + S[k-55]] (modulo 1000000)

If Caller(n) = Called(n) then the user is assumed to have misdialled and
the call fails; otherwise the call is successful.

From the start of the records, we say that any pair of users X and Y are
friends if X calls Y or vice-versa. Similarly, X is a friend of a friend
of Z if X is a friend of Y and Y is a friend of Z; and so on for longer
chains.

The Prime Minister's phone number is 524287. After how many successful
calls, not counting misdials, will 99% of the users (including the PM) be
a friend, or a friend of a friend etc., of the Prime Minister?

   The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer
   b, denoted by a↑↑b or ^ba, is recursively defined by:

Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:

![](files/p_189_grid.gif)

We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours:
red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same
colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are
said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.
Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.

For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:

   Let x be a real number.
   A best approximation to x for the denominator bound d is a rational number
   r/s in reduced form, with s ≤ d, such that any rational number which is
   closer to x than r/s has a denominator larger than d:

                           |p/q-x| < |r/s-x| ⇒ q > d

   For example, the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 20 is
   18/5 and the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 30 is
   101/28.

   Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to √n for the

   Build a triangle from all positive integers in the following way:
   
   ![](files/p_196.png)

   Each positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle.

   A set of three primes is called a prime triplet if one of the three primes
   has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.

   For example, in the second row, the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements of
   some prime triplet.

   If row 8 is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of some
   prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.
   If row 9 is considered, it contains only one prime which is an element of
   some prime triplet: 37.

   Define S(n) as the sum of the primes in row n which are elements of any
   prime triplet.
   Then S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.

Problem 198
===========


   A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a
   rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s ≤ d, so that any rational
   number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q > d.

   Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for
   all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40 has
   the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6.We
   shall call a real number x ambiguous, if there is at least one denominator
   bound for which x possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous
   number is necessarily rational.

   How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q,0 < x < 1/100, are there whose
   denominator q does not exceed 10^8?

Problem 201
===========

For any set A of numbers, let sum(A) be the sum of the elements of A.
Consider the set B = {1,3,6,8,10,11}.
There are 20 subsets of B containing three elements, and their sums are:

    sum({1,3,6}) = 10,
    sum({1,3,8}) = 12,
    sum({1,3,10}) = 14,
    sum({1,3,11}) = 15,
    sum({1,6,8}) = 15,
    sum({1,6,10}) = 17,
    sum({1,6,11}) = 18,
    sum({1,8,10}) = 19,
    sum({1,8,11}) = 20,
    sum({1,10,11}) = 22,
    sum({3,6,8}) = 17,
    sum({3,6,10}) = 19,
    sum({3,6,11}) = 20,
    sum({3,8,10}) = 21,
    sum({3,8,11}) = 22,
    sum({3,10,11}) = 24,

    sum({6,8,11}) = 25,
    sum({6,10,11}) = 27,
    sum({8,10,11}) = 29.

Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.
For a set A, let U(A,k) be the set of unique sums of k-element subsets of
A, in our example we find U(B,3) = {10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29} and
sum(U(B,3)) = 156.

Now consider the 100-element set S = {1^2, 2^2, ... , 100^2}.
S has 100891344545564193334812497256 50-element subsets.

Determine the sum of all integers which are the sum of exactly one of the
50-element subsets of S, i.e. find sum(U(S,50)).

Problem 212
===========


   An axis-aligned cuboid, specified by parameters { (x[0],y[0],z[0]),
   (dx,dy,dz) }, consists of all points (X,Y,Z) such that x[0] ≤ X ≤ x[0]+dx,
   y[0] ≤ Y ≤ y[0]+dy and z[0] ≤ Z ≤ z[0]+dz. The volume of the cuboid is the
   product, dx × dy × dz. The combined volume of a collection of cuboids is
   the volume of their union and will be less than the sum of the individual
   volumes if any cuboids overlap.

   Let C[1],...,C[50000] be a collection of 50000 axis-aligned cuboids such
   that C[n] has parameters

   x[0] = S[6n-5] modulo 10000
   y[0] = S[6n-4] modulo 10000
   z[0] = S[6n-3] modulo 10000
   dx = 1 + (S[6n-2] modulo 399)
   dy = 1 + (S[6n-1] modulo 399)
   dz = 1 + (S[6n] modulo 399)

   where S[1],...,S[300000] come from the "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":

   For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, S[k] = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k^3]   (modulo 1000000)
   For 56 ≤ k, S[k] = [S[k-24] + S[k-55]]   (modulo 1000000)

   Thus, C[1] has parameters {(7,53,183),(94,369,56)}, C[2] has parameters
   {(2383,3563,5079),(42,212,344)}, and so on.

   The combined volume of the first 100 cuboids, C[1],...,C[100], is
   723581599.

   What is the combined volume of all 50000 cuboids, C[1],...,C[50000] ?

   Let φ be Euler's totient function, i.e. for a natural number n,φ(n) is the
   number of k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, for which gcd(k,n) = 1.

   By iterating φ, each positive integer generates a decreasing chain of
   numbers ending in 1.
   E.g. if we start with 5 the sequence 5,4,2,1 is generated.
   Here is a listing of all chains with length 4:

                                                                      5,4,2,1

Problem 217
===========


   A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first
   ⌈^k/[2]⌉ digits sum to the same value as its last ⌈^k/[2]⌉ digits, where
   ⌈x⌉, pronounced ceiling of x, is the smallest integer ≥ x, thus ⌈π⌉ = 4
   and ⌈5⌉ = 5.

   So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.

   Let T(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10^n.
   Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890.

Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.The area
of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.

Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1. 
Also c is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
* it is a primitive right angled triangle
* its hypotenuse is a perfect square

We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
* it is a perfect right angled triangle and
* its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.

How many perfect right-angled triangles with c≤10^16 exist that are not
super-perfect?

Problem 219
===========


Let A and B be bit strings (sequences of 0's and 1's).
If A is equal to the leftmost length(A) bits of B, then A is said to be a
prefix of B.
For example, 00110 is a prefix of 001101001, but not of 00111 or 100110.

A prefix-free code of size n is a collection of n distinct bit strings
such that no string is a prefix of any other. For example, this is a
prefix-free code of size 6:

    0000, 0001, 001, 01, 10, 11

Now suppose that it costs one penny to transmit a '0' bit, but four pence
to transmit a '1'.
Then the total cost of the prefix-free code shown above is 35 pence, which
happens to be the cheapest possible for the skewed pricing scheme in
question.
In short, we write Cost(6) = 35.

What is Cost(10^9)?

Problem 220
===========


Let D[0] be the two-letter string "Fa". For n≥1, derive D[n] from D[n-1]
by the string-rewriting rules:

    "a" → "aRbFR"
    "b" → "LFaLb"

Thus, D[0] = "Fa", D[1] = "FaRbFR", D[2] = "FaRbFRRLFaLbFR", and so on.

These strings can be interpreted as instructions to a computer graphics
program, with "F" meaning "draw forward one unit", "L" meaning "turn left
90 degrees", "R" meaning "turn right 90 degrees", and "a" and "b" being
ignored. The initial position of the computer cursor is (0,0), pointing up
towards (0,1).

Then D[n] is an exotic drawing known as the Heighway Dragon of order n.
For example, D[10] is shown below; counting each "F" as one step, the
highlighted spot at (18,16) is the position reached after 500 steps.

"The Chase" is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.

The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite players
having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.
If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; if
he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; otherwise,
he keeps the die for the next turn.
The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled
and passed; that player has then lost.

Let S[n] be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices v[k]
(k = 1,2,…,n) have coordinates:

	  x[k]   =   cos( ^2k-1/[n] × 180° )
	  y[k]   =   sin( ^2k-1/[n] × 180° )

Each S[n] is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points
on the perimeter and in the interior.

The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of adding
every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed
coordinate-wise: (u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y).

Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because

    3600 = 30^2 + 3×30^2

    3600 = 45^2 + 7×15^2

Similarly, we find that 88201 = 99^2 + 280^2 = 287^2 + 2×54^2 = 283^2 +
3×52^2 = 197^2 + 7×84^2.

Problem 230
===========

For any two strings of digits, A and B, we define F[A,B] to be the
sequence (A,B,AB,BAB,ABBAB,...) in which each term is the concatenation of
the previous two.

Further, we define D[A,B](n) to be the nth digit in the first term of
F[A,B] that contains at least n digits.

Example:

Let A=1415926535, B=8979323846. We wish to find D[A,B](35), say.

The first few terms of F[A,B] are:

    1415926535
    8979323846
    14159265358979323846
    897932384614159265358979323846
    14159265358979323846897932384614159265358979323846

Then D[A,B](35) is the 35th digit in the fifth term, which is 9.

Now we use for A the first 100 digits of π behind the decimal point:

   14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510

   For an integer n ≥ 4, we define the lower prime square root of n, denoted

   So, for example, lps(4) = 2 = ups(4), lps(1000) = 31, ups(1000) = 37.
   Let us call an integer n ≥ 4 semidivisible, if one of lps(n) and ups(n)
   divides n, but not both.

   The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding 15 is 30, the numbers
   are 8, 10 and 12.
   15 is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both lps(15) = 3 and

   Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect
   condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - i.e. products gone bad.

   The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:

     • The five per-product spoilage rates for each supplier are equal to the
       number of products gone bad divided by the number of products
       supplied, for each of the five products in turn.
     • The overall spoilage rate for each supplier is equal to the total
       number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products
       provided by that supplier.

   To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product
   spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor
   (ratio of spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall
   spoilage rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of m.

   There are thirty-five m>1 for which this surprising result could have
   occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.

   What's the largest possible value of m?

Problem 238
===========


   Create a sequence of numbers using the "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random
   number generator:

                          s[0]   = 14025256
                          s[n+1] = s[n]^2 mod 20300713

   Concatenate these numbers  s[0]s[1]s[2]… to create a string w of infinite
   length.
   Then, w = 14025256741014958470038053646…

   For a positive integer k, if no substring of w exists with a sum of digits
   equal to k, p(k) is defined to be zero. If at least one substring of w
   exists with a sum of digits equal to k, we define p(k) = z, where z is the
   starting position of the earliest such substring.

   For instance:

   The substrings 1, 14, 1402, …
   with respective sums of digits equal to 1, 5, 7, …
   start at position 1, hence p(1) = p(5) = p(7) = … = 1.

   The substrings 4, 402, 4025, …
   with respective sums of digits equal to 4, 6, 11, …
   start at position 2, hence p(4) = p(6) = p(11) = … = 2.

   The substrings 02, 0252, …
   with respective sums of digits equal to 2, 9, …
   start at position 3, hence p(2) = p(9) = … = 3.

   Note that substring 025 starting at position 3, has a sum of digits equal
   to 7, but there was an earlier substring (starting at position 1) with a
   sum of digits equal to 7, so p(7) = 1, not 3.

   We can verify that, for 0 < k ≤ 10^3, ∑ p(k) = 4742.

   Find ∑ p(k), for 0 < k ≤ 2·10^15.

   Given the set {1,2,...,n}, we define f(n,k) as the number of its k-element
   subsets with an odd sum of elements. For example, f(5,3) = 4, since the

   i.e.: {1,2,4}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,4} and {2,4,5}.

   When all three values n, k and f(n,k) are odd, we say that they make
   an odd-triplet [n,k,f(n,k)].

   There are exactly five odd-triplets with n ≤ 10, namely:

You probably know the game Fifteen Puzzle. Here, instead of numbered
tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.

A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left, Right,
Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from configuration (S),
by the sequence LULUR we reach the configuration (E):

(S) ![](files/p_244_start.gif), (E) ![](files/p_244_example.gif)

For each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):

Problem 253
===========

A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw
pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a
line, reveal the numbers 1 to 40 in order.

Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the
caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the
pieces at random and places them in the correct order.
As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments
that gradually merge together.
The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally
increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before
finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).

For example:
   
| Piece Placed | Segments So Far |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 12           | 1               |
| 4            | 2               |
| 29           | 3               |
| 6            | 4               |
| 34           | 5               |
| 5            | 4               |
| 35           | 4               |
| …            | …               |

Let M be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random
tidy-up of the caterpillar.
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each M is

| M   | Possibilities |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1   | 512           |
| 2   | 250912        |
| 3   | 1815264       |
| 4   | 1418112       |
| 5   | 144000        |

so the most likely value of M is 3 and the average value is 385643/113400 = 3.400732, 
rounded to six decimal places.

The most likely value of M for a forty-piece caterpillar is 11; but what
is the average value of M?

Problem 255
===========


We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer n as the square
root of n rounded to the nearest integer.

The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer
arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of n:

Let d be the number of digits of the number n.
If d is odd, set x[0] = 2×10^(d-1)⁄2.
If d is even, set x[0] = 7×10^(d-2)⁄2.
Repeat:

![](files/p_255_Heron.gif)

until x[k+1] = x[k].

As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of n = 4321.
n has 4 digits, so x[0] = 7×10^(4-2)⁄2 = 70.

![](files/p_255_Example.gif)

Since x[2] = x[1], we stop here.
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root
of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137…).

The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly
low.
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer
(10,000 ≤ n ≤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the
average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).

Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of
iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number
(10^13 ≤ n < 10^14)?
Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

Problem 256
===========


Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room,
without overlap.

Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there
are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that
can be covered.

For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer
dimensions a, b and even size s = a·b.
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and —
without loss of generality — we add the condition a ≤ b.

There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no
points where corners of four different mats meet.
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:

![](files/p_256_tatami3.gif)

The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is
not: a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.

Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with
tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.

The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7×10.
All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are:
1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.
Hence, T(70) = 1.

Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5
tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320:
20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.
In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.

Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.

   A positive integer will be called reachable if it can result from an

     • Uses the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each.
     • Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the
       digits 2, 3 and 4 we obtain the number 234).
     • Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition,
       subtraction, multiplication and division) are allowed.
     • Each operation can be used any number of times, or not at all.
     • Unary minus is not allowed.
     • Any number of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define the
       order of operations.

Problem 260
===========


   A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
   At her turn, a player removes one or more stones from the piles. However,
   if she takes stones from more than one pile, she must remove the same
   number of stones from each of the selected piles.

   In other words, the player chooses some N>0 and removes:

     • N stones from any single pile; or
     • N stones from each of any two piles (2N total); or
     • N stones from each of the three piles (3N total).

   The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.

   A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.
   For example, (0,0,13), (0,11,11) and (5,5,5) are winning configurations
   because the first player can immediately remove all stones.

   A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no
   matter what the first player does.
   For example, (0,1,2) and (1,3,3) are losing configurations: any legal move
   leaves a winning configuration for the second player.

   Consider all losing configurations (x[i],y[i],z[i]) where x[i] ≤ y[i] ≤
   z[i] ≤ 100.
   We can verify that Σ(x[i]+y[i]+z[i]) = 173895 for these.

   Let us call a positive integer k a square-pivot, if there is a pair of
   integers m > 0 and n ≥ k, such that the sum of the (m+1) consecutive
   squares up to k equals the sum of the m consecutive squares from (n+1) on:

                 (k-m)^2 + ... + k^2 = (n+1)^2 + ... + (n+m)^2.

   Some small square-pivots are

     • 4: 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
     • 21: 20^2 + 21^2 = 29^2
     • 24: 21^2 + 22^2 + 23^2 + 24^2 = 25^2 + 26^2 + 27^2
     • 110: 108^2 + 109^2 + 110^2 = 133^2 + 134^2

   Find the sum of all distinct square-pivots ≤ 10^10.

The following equation represents the continuous topography of a
mountainous region, giving the elevation h at any point (x,y):

![](files/p_262_formula1.gif)

A mosquito intends to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without leaving
the area given by 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1600.

Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a
point A', having elevation f. Then, while remaining at the same elevation
f, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point B' directly
above B.

First, determine f[min] which is the minimum constant elevation allowing
such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.
Then, find the length of the shortest path between A' and B', while flying
at that constant elevation f[min].

Give that length as your answer, rounded to three decimal places.

Note: For convenience, the elevation function shown above is repeated
below, in a form suitable for most programming languages:
h=( 5000-0.005*(x*x+y*y+x*y)+12.5*(x+y) ) * exp(
-abs(0.000001*(x*x+y*y)-0.0015*(x+y)+0.7) )

2^N binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the N-digit
clockwise subsequences are distinct.

For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:

![](files/p_265_BinaryCircles.gif)

For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order,
are:
000, 001, 010, 101, 011, 111, 110 and 100.

Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the
binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most
significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for N=3
are thus represented as 23 and 29:
						   00010111 [2] = 23
						   00011101 [2] = 29

Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see
that S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.

Find S(5).

  of the square, and having integer coordinates.
* Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.
* Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.

Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number

===========


   For each integer p > 1 coprime to 10 there is a positive divisibility
   multiplier m < p which preserves divisibility by p for the following
   function on any positive integer, n:

   f(n) = (all but the last digit of n) + (the last digit of n) * m

   That is, if m is the divisibility multiplier for p, then f(n) is divisible
   by p if and only if n is divisible by p.

   (When n is much larger than p, f(n) will be less than n and repeated
   application of f provides a multiplicative divisibility test for p.)

   For example, the divisibility multiplier for 113 is 34.

   f(76275) = 7627 + 5 * 34 = 7797 : 76275 and 7797 are both divisible by 113
   f(12345) = 1234 + 5 * 34 = 1404 : 12345 and 1404 are both not divisible by

===========


   A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value
   a[1] in the following way:

   a[n+1] = a[n]/3 if a[n] is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large
   downward step, "D".

   a[n+1] = (4a[n] + 2)/3 if a[n] divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. We
   shall denote this as an upward step, "U".

   a[n+1] = (2a[n] - 1)/3 if a[n] divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. We
   shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".

   The sequence terminates when some a[n] = 1.

   Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.
   For instance if a[1]=231, then the sequence
   {a[n]}={231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1} corresponds to the steps
   "DdDddUUdDD".

   Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence
   "DdDddUUdDD....".
   For instance, if a[1]=1004064, then the sequence is
   DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.
   In fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a[1] > 10^6 that begins with the

   0.

   Note that for a given set of a[k], it may be that not all values of b are
   possible.
   For instance, if a[1] = 5 and a[2] = 7, there are no q[1] ≥ 0 and q[2] ≥ 0
   such that b could be
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 or 23.
   In fact, 23 is the largest impossible value of b for a[1] = 5 and a[2] =
   7.
   We therefore call f(5, 7) = 23.
   Similarly, it can be shown that f(6, 10, 15)=29 and f(14, 22, 77) = 195.

   For example, if k = 6, a = 0.2 and b = 0.85, then
   (k·a+1)^2 + (k·b+1)^2 = 42.05.
   The square root of 42.05 is 6.484... and when rounded to the nearest

* "0" denotes a split:
  the current 2^n×2^n region is divided into 4 sub-regions of dimension 2^n-1×2^n-1,
  the next bits contains the description of the top left, top right,
  bottom left and bottom right sub-regions - in that order;
* "10" indicates that the current region contains only black pixels;
* "11" indicates that the current region contains only white pixels.

Let C(x,y) be a circle passing through the points (x, y), (x, y+1),
(x+1, y) and (x+1, y+1).

For positive integers m and n, let E(m,n) be a configuration which
consists of the m·n circles:
{ C(x,y): 0 ≤ x < m, 0 ≤ y < n, x and y are integers }

An Eulerian cycle on E(m,n) is a closed path that passes through each arc
exactly once.
Many such paths are possible on E(m,n), but we are only interested in
those which are not self-crossing: A non-crossing path just touches itself
at lattice points, but it never crosses itself.

The image below shows E(3,3) and an example of an Eulerian non-crossing
path.

![](files/p_289_euler.gif)

Let L(m,n) be the number of Eulerian non-crossing paths on E(m,n).
For example, L(1,2) = 2, L(2,2) = 37 and L(3,3) = 104290.

Find L(6,10) mod 10^10.

Problem 293
===========


   An even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power of
   2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.
   The first twelve admissible numbers are 2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.

   If N is admissible, the smallest integer M > 1 such that N+M is prime,
   will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for N.

   For example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime
   factors are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.
   The next prime number after 631 is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number
   for 630 is M=11.
   It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.

   Find the sum of all distinct pseudo-Fortunate numbers for admissible
   numbers N less than 10^9.

   We call the convex area enclosed by two circles a lenticular hole if:

     • The centres of both circles are on lattice points.
     • The two circles intersect at two distinct lattice points.
     • The interior of the convex area enclosed by both circles does not
       contain any lattice points.

   Consider the circles:
   C[0]: x^2+y^2=25
   C[1]: (x+4)^2+(y-4)^2=1
   C[2]: (x-12)^2+(y-4)^2=65

   The circles C[0], C[1] and C[2] are drawn in the picture below.

   C[0] and C[1] form a lenticular hole, as well as C[0] and C[2].

   We call an ordered pair of positive real numbers (r[1], r[2]) a lenticular
   pair if there exist two circles with radii r[1] and r[2] that form a
   lenticular hole.We can verify that (1, 5) and (5, √65) are the lenticular
   pairs of the example above.

   Let L(N) be the number of distinct lenticular pairs (r[1], r[2]) for which
   0 < r[1] ≤ r[2] ≤ N.

Problem 297
===========


   Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
   previous two terms.
   Starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
   34, 55, 89.

   Every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of nonconsecutive
   terms of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, 100 = 3 + 8 + 89.
   Such a sum is called the Zeckendorf representation of the number.

   For any integer n>0, let z(n) be the number of terms in the Zeckendorf
   representation of n.
   Thus, z(5) = 1, z(14) = 2, z(100) = 3 etc.
   Also, for 0<n<10^6, ∑ z(n) = 7894453.

   Larry and Robin play a memory game involving of a sequence of random
   numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time.
   Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number
   is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the
   player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if
   his memory is full.

   Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed
   numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which
   number to remove:
   Larry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the
   longest time.
   Robin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the

Problem 299
===========


Four points with integer coordinates are selected:
A(a, 0), B(b, 0), C(0, c) and D(0, d), with 0 < a < b and 0 < c < d.
Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that
the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all similar.

![](files/p_299_ThreeSimTri.gif)

It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if a=c.

So, given that a=c, we are looking for triplets (a,b,d) such that at least
one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three
triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.

For example, if (a,b,d)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point
P(1,1) satisfies the above condition. Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and
(2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for
both.

If b+d < 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P
exists.
If b+d < 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that
point P exists.

If b+d < 100 000 000, how many distinct triplets (a,b,d) are there such
that point P exists?

Problem 300
===========

In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting
of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH.
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is
considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2^n distinct proteins
consisting of n elements.

When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in
such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible,
since this is energetically advantageous.
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the
P-elements on the outside.
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will
only consider protein folding in two dimensions.

The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be
folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).

![](files/p_300_protein.gif)

The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would
never occur naturally.
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points,
which is optimal for this string.

Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position
along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal
folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be
850 / 2^8=3.3203125.

What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of
a random protein string of length 15?

result.

Problem 301
===========


Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in
turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.

We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as
follows:
- At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.
- On his turn the player removes any positive number of stones from any
single heap.
- The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.

If (n[1],n[2],n[3]) indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size
n[1], n[2] and n[3] then there is a simple function X(n[1],n[2],n[3]) —
that you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself — that returns:

 • zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
   eventually lose; or
 • non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
   eventually win.

For example X(1,2,3) = 0 because, no matter what the current player does,
his opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size,
at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by his
opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To
illustrate:
- current player moves to (1,2,1)
- opponent moves to (1,0,1)
- current player moves to (0,0,1)
- opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.

For how many positive integers n ≤ 2^30 does X(n,2n,3n) = 0 ?

Problem 302
===========

A positive integer n is powerful if p^2 is a divisor of n for every prime
factor p in n.

A positive integer n is a perfect power if n can be expressed as a power
of another positive integer.

A positive integer n is an Achilles number if n is powerful but not a
perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 =
2^5·3^3 and 1800 = 2^3·3^2·5^2.

We shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S and
φ(S) are Achilles numbers.^1
For example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: φ(864) = 288 = 2^5·3^2.
However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: φ(1800) = 480 =
2^5·3^1·5^1.

There are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 10^4 and 656 below 10^8.

How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 10^18?

Problem 306
===========


The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:

Two players start with a strip of n white squares and they take alternate turns.

On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them black.

The first player who cannot make a move loses.

* If n = 1, there are no valid moves, so the first player loses
  automatically.
* If n = 2, there is only one valid move, after which the second player
  loses.
* If n = 3, there are two valid moves, but both leave a situation where
  the second player loses.
* If n = 4, there are three valid moves for the first player; she can
  win the game by painting the two middle squares.
* If n = 5, there are four valid moves for the first player (shown below
  in red); but no matter what she does, the second player (blue) wins.

So, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 5, there are 3 values of n for which the first player can
force a win.
Similarly, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, there are 40 values of n for which the first
player can force a win.

For 1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000, how many values of n are there for which the first
player can force a win?

Problem 308
===========

A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list
of fractions.

The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer,
which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran
program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list
which will leave it an integer.

For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote
for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:

17/91, 78/85, 19/51, 23/38, 29/33, 77/29, 95/23, 77/19, 1/17, 11/13, 13/11, 15/2, 1/7, 55/1

Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program
produce the sequence:

15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, 4, 30, ..., 136, 8, 60, ..., 544,
32, 240, ...

The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 2^2, 2^3, 2^5, ...
It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime
exponents and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in
proper order!

If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem
7 (find the 10001st prime), how many iterations would be needed until the
program produces 2^10001st prime?

lines, each line running from post to post.

The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the
entire 250 000 m^2 area. The [Duchy of Grand Fenwick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick), has a tighter
budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape
would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.

You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.For a 2000
meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m^2 area theenclosed-area/wall-length
ratio is 125.
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better: if
you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area
will be equal to π*250^2 m^2 and the perimeter will be π*500 m, so the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.

However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75
m and 75√2 m the total area becomes 238750 m^2 and the perimeter becomes
1400+300√2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87,
which is significantly better.

Problem 315
===========

![](files/p_315_clocks.gif)

Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two "digital
root" clocks.
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step
by step.

When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the
calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the
result.
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: "137" →
"11" → "2" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.

Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal
(top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left,
bottom-right).
Number "1" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number "4" is
made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and
bottom-right. Number "8" lights them all.

The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
To turn on a "2" will cost 5 transitions, while a "7" will cost only 4
transitions.

Sam and Max built two different clocks.

Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows "137", then the panel
is turned off, then the next number ("11") is turned on, then the panel is
turned off again and finally the last number ("2") is turned on and, after
some time, off.
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:

    "137" : (2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions ("137" on/off).
    "11"  : (2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions ("11" on/off).
    "2"   : (5) × 2 = 10 transitions ("2" on/off).

For a grand total of 40 transitions.

Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it
is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for
the next number.
For number 137, Max's clock requires:

            2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions ("137" on)
    "137" : 7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for
            number "11").
            0 transitions (number "11" is already turned on correctly)
    "11"  : 3 transitions (to turn off the first "1" and the bottom part of
            the second "1";
            the top part is common with number "2").
            4 tansitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a
    "2"   : "2")
            5 transitions (to turn off number "2").

For a grand total of 30 transitions.

Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10^7 and B =
2×10^7.
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by
Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.

Problem 316
===========

Let p = p[1] p[2] p[3] ... be an infinite sequence of random digits,
selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.
It can be seen that p corresponds to the real number 0.p[1] p[2] p[3] ....
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval
[0,1) is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits
selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.

For any positive integer n with d decimal digits, let k be the smallest
index such that
p[k, ]p[k+1], ...p[k+d-1] are the decimal digits of n, in the same order.
Also, let g(n) be the expected value of k; it can be proven that g(n) is
always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.

For example, if n = 535, then
    for p = 31415926535897...., we get k = 9
    for p = 355287143650049560000490848764084685354..., we get k = 36
etc and we find that g(535) = 1008.

===========


Consider the real number √2+√3.
When we calculate the even powers of √2+√3we get:
    (√2+√3)^2 = 9.898979485566356...
    (√2+√3)^4 = 97.98979485566356...
    (√2+√3)^6 = 969.998969071069263...
    (√2+√3)^8 = 9601.99989585502907...
    (√2+√3)^10 = 95049.999989479221...
    (√2+√3)^12 = 940897.9999989371855...
    (√2+√3)^14 = 9313929.99999989263...
    (√2+√3)^16 = 92198401.99999998915...

It looks like that the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the
fractional part of these powers is non-decreasing.
In fact it can be proven that the fractional part of (√2+√3)^2n approaches
1 for large n.

Consider all real numbers of the form √p+√q with p and q positive integers
and p<q, such that the fractional part of (√p+√q)^2n approaches 1 for
large n.

Let C(p,q,n) be the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the
fractional part of
(√p+√q)^2n.

Let N(p,q) be the minimal value of n such that C(p,q,n) ≥ 2011.

A horizontal row comprising of 2n + 1 squares has n red counters placed at
one end and n blue counters at the other end, being separated by a single
empty square in the centre. For example, when n = 3.

![](files/p_321_swapping_counters_1.gif)

A counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump over
another counter (hop) as long as the square next to that counter is
unoccupied.

reverse the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the red
counters to the right and all the blue counters to the left.

It can be verified M(3) = 15, which also happens to be a triangle number.

If we create a sequence based on the values of n for which M(n) is a

Problem 325
===========


A game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a
player removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of
stones she removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in
the smaller pile.

E.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in
the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player
can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.

The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.

A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For
example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the
first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.

A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no
matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing
configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the
second player.

Define S(N) as the sum of (x[i]+y[i]) for all losing configurations
(x[i],y[i]), 0 < x[i] < y[i] ≤ N. We can verify that S(10) = 211 and
S(10^4) = 230312207313.

Problem 327
===========


A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.

![](files/p_327_rooms_of_doom.gif)

Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door
automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A
machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each
room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect
that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an
unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become
permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely
store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.

If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you
entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in
that room forever!

However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible.
For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card
in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the
start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine
you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the
box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to
travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel
through all three rooms using six security cards in total.

It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of 123 security
cards while carrying a maximum of 3 cards.

Let C be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.

Let R be the number of rooms to travel through.

Let M(C,R) be the minimum number of cards required from the dispensing
machine to travel through R rooms carrying up to a maximum of C cards at
any time.

For example, M(3,6)=123 and M(4,6)=23.
And, ΣM(C,6)=146 for 3 ≤ C ≤ 4.

You are given that ΣM(C,10)=10382 for 3 ≤ C ≤ 10.

Find ΣM(C,30) for 3 ≤ C ≤ 40.

Problem 328
===========


We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
{1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, has a
cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers:

* "Your guess is lower than the hidden number", or
* "Yes, that's it!", or
* "Your guess is higher than the hidden number".

Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e.
the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.

If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "2". The answer
will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).

If n=8, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our
first question would be "4" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we
will need one or two additional questions.
Let our second question be "6". If the hidden number is still higher than
6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.
Thus, our third question will be "7" and the total cost for this
worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.

We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking "5" as
our first question.
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second
question will be "7", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number
is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question
will be "3" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question
will be "1", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.
Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better
than what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy; it is
also better than or equal to any other strategy.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.

Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as
described above.
Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.
Similarly, C(100) = 400 and ![](files/p_328_sum1.gif)C(n) = 17575.

Problem 333
===========


All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every
term of the partition can be expressed as 2^ix3^j, where i,j ≥ 0.

Let's consider only those such partitions where none of the terms can
divide any of the other terms.
For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2^1x3^0 + 2^1x3^1 +
2^0x3^2) would not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the
partition 17 = 16 + 1 = (2^4x3^0 + 2^0x3^0) since 1 can divide 16. The
only valid partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (2^3x3^0 + 2^0x3^2).

Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11
having the following two partitions.

    11 = 2 + 9 = (2^1x3^0 + 2^0x3^2)
    11 = 8 + 3 = (2^3x3^0 + 2^0x3^1)

Let's define P(n) as the number of valid partitions of n. For example,
P(11) = 2.

Let's consider only the prime integers q which would have a single valid
partition such as P(17).

The sum of the primes q <100 such that P(q)=1 equals 233.

Find the sum of the primes q <1000000 such that P(q)=1.

A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two
beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.
The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.

For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans
respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will
finish the game:

Problem 335
===========


Whenever Peter feels bored, he places some bowls, containing one bean
each, in a circle. After this, he takes all the beans out of a certain
bowl and drops them one by one in the bowls going clockwise. He repeats
this, starting from the bowl he dropped the last bean in, until the
initial situation appears again. For example with 5 bowls he acts as
follows:

![](files/p_335_mancala.gif)

So with 5 bowls it takes Peter 15 moves to return to the initial
situation.

Let M(x) represent the number of moves required to return to the initial
situation, starting with x bowls. Thus, M(5) = 15. It can also be verified
that M(100) = 10920.

Find ![](files/p_335_sum.gif)M(2^k+1). Give your answer modulo 7^9.

Problem 336
===========


A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However,
sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in
the correct order.
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating
turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train
moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The
remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then
rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to
obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are
separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has
been achieved.

However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency,
so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the
correct place, then carriage B, and so on.

Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we
shall call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him
five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be
solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown
below.

![](files/p_336_maximix.gif)

It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six
carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is DFAECB.

Find the 2011th lexicographic maximix arrangement for eleven carriages.

Problem 338
===========

A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions w × h is given.
Its grid spacing is 1.
When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange
those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different
dimensions.

For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 4 , we can make rectangles
with dimensions 18 × 2, 12 × 3 and 6 × 6 by cutting and rearranging as
below:

![](files/p_338_gridpaper.gif)

Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 8 , we can make rectangles
with dimensions 18 × 4 and 12 × 6 .

For a pair w and h, let F(w,h) be the number of distinct rectangles that
can be made from a sheet with dimensions w × h .
For example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2.
Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in
F(w,h).
Note also that rectangles with dimensions w × h and dimensions h × w are
not considered distinct.

For an integer N, let G(N) be the sum of F(w,h) for all pairs w and h
which satisfy 0 < h ≤ w ≤ N.
We can verify that G(10) = 55, G(10^3) = 971745 and G(10^5) = 9992617687.

For any positive integer k, a finite sequence a[i] of fractions x[i]/y[i]
is defined by:

    a[1] = 1/k and
    a[i] = (x[i-1]+1)/(y[i-1]-1) reduced to lowest terms for i>1.

When a[i] reaches some integer n, the sequence stops. (That is, when y[i]=1.)

Define f(k) = n.
For example, for k = 20:

1/20 → 2/19 → 3/18 = 1/6 → 2/5 → 3/4 → 4/3 → 5/2 → 6/1 = 6

So f(20) = 6.

===========


One variant of N.G. de Bruijn's silver dollar game can be described as
follows:

On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per
square. Only one coin, called the silver dollar, has any value. Two
players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a
regular or a special move.

A regular move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more
squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on or
over another coin.

Alternatively, the player can choose to make the special move of pocketing
the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular moves
are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.

The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.

![](files/p_344_silverdollar.gif)

A winning configuration is an arrangement of coins on the strip where the
first player can force a win no matter what the second player does.

Let W(n,c) be the number of winning configurations for a strip of n
squares, c worthless coins and one silver dollar.

Problem 352
===========


   Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known
   to affect 2% of the sheep population.An accurate and extremely sensitive
   PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative
   result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.

   Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of
   performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:

   The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. For each
   group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed.
   Then,

     • If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to
       be virus-free.
     • If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a
       separate test for each animal) to determine the affected
       individual(s).

   Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02,
   the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:

     • Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98^5 =
       0.9039207968.
     • Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968
       = 0.0960792032.

   Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 × 5
   = 1.480396016.
   Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only
   1.480396016 × 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more
   than 70% !

   Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it
   can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is
   sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by
   mixing different samples). E.g.:

     • We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It
       can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be
       negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only
       be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.
     • If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and
       the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to
       run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).
     • We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals
       in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total
       expected number of tests will be minimised.

   To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction
   we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we
   start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must
   be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached
   for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.

   For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing
   scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just
   4.155452 tests!

   Using the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of
   tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p
   to be present in any individual.
   Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25,
   0.10) = 12.702124.

   Find ΣT(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.
   Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.

   A moon could be described by the sphere C(r) with centre (0,0,0) and

   There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of C(r) with
   integer coordinates. The station at (0,0,r) is called North Pole station,
   the station at (0,0,-r) is called South Pole station.

   All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the
   great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky.
   If d is the length of the road between two stations, (d/(π r))^2 is a
   measure for the risk of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road).
   If the journey includes more than two stations, the risk of the journey is
   the sum of risks of the used roads.

   A direct journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station has
   the length πr and risk 1. The journey from the North Pole station to the
   South Pole station via (0,r,0) has the same length, but a smaller risk:
   (½πr/(πr))^2+(½πr/(πr))^2=0.5.

   The minimal risk of a journey from the North Pole station to the South

Problem 358
===========

A cyclic number with n digits has a very interesting property:
When it is multiplied by 1, 2, 3, 4, ... n, all the products have exactly
the same digits, in the same order, but rotated in a circular fashion!

The smallest cyclic number is the 6-digit number 142857:

    142857 × 1 = 142857
    142857 × 2 = 285714
    142857 × 3 = 428571
    142857 × 4 = 571428
    142857 × 5 = 714285
    142857 × 6 = 857142

The next cyclic number is 0588235294117647 with 16 digits:
   
    0588235294117647 × 1 = 0588235294117647
    0588235294117647 × 2 = 1176470588235294
    0588235294117647 × 3 = 1764705882352941
    ...
    0588235294117647 × 16 = 9411764705882352

Note that for cyclic numbers, leading zeros are important.

There is only one cyclic number for which, the eleven leftmost digits are
00000000137 and the five rightmost digits are 56789 (i.e., it has the form
00000000137...56789 with an unknown number of digits in the middle). Find
the sum of all its digits.

Problem 359
===========


An infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) are lined up to get
a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite
number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an
infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.).

Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the nth
person is assigned a room: person n gets the first vacant room in the
lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:

* the floor is empty
* floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that
  floor is person m, then m + n is a perfect square

Person 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.
Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect
square.
Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.
Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.

Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.

Define P(f, r) to be n if person n occupies room r in floor f, and 0 if no
person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
   
    P(1, 1) = 1
    P(1, 2) = 3
    P(2, 1) = 2
    P(10, 20) = 440
    P(25, 75) = 4863
    P(99, 100) = 19454

Find the sum of all P(f, r) for all positive f and r such that f × r =
71328803586048 and give the last 8 digits as your answer.

Problem 361
===========


The Thue-Morse sequence {T[n]} is a binary sequence satisfying:

* T[0] = 0
* T[2n] = T[n]
* T[2n+1] = 1 - T[n]

The first several terms of {T[n]} are given as follows: 01101001100101101001011001101001...

We define {A[n]} as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary
expression of each element appears as a subsequence in {T[n]}.
For example, the decimal number 18 is expressed as 10010 in binary. 10010
appears in {T[n]} (T[8] to T[12]), so 18 is an element of {A[n]}.
The decimal number 14 is expressed as 1110 in binary. 1110 never appears
in {T[n]}, so 14 is not an element of {A[n]}.

The first several terms of A[n] are given as follows:

		  n     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   9   10  11  12  …
		  A[n]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  9  10  11  12  13  18  …

We can also verify that A[100] = 3251 and A[1000] = 80852364498.

Consider the number 54.

54 can be factored in 7 distinct ways into one or more factors larger than 1:

54, 2×27, 3×18, 6×9, 3×3×6, 2×3×9 and 2×3×3×3.

If we require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain:
3×3×6 and 2×3×3×3.

Let's call Fsf(n) the number of ways n can be factored into one or more
squarefree factors larger than 1, soFsf(54)=2.

Problem 363
===========

A cubic Bézier curve is defined by four points: P[0], P[1], P[2] and P[3].

The curve is constructed as follows:
On the segments P[0]P[1], P[1]P[2] and P[2]P[3] the points Q[0],Q[1] and
Q[2] are drawn such that
P[0]Q[0]/P[0]P[1]=P[1]Q[1]/P[1]P[2]=P[2]Q[2]/P[2]P[3]=t (t in [0,1]).
On the segments Q[0]Q[1] and Q[1]Q[2] the points R[0] and R[1] are drawn
such thatQ[0]R[0]/Q[0]Q[1]=Q[1]R[1]/Q[1]Q[2]=t for the same value of t.
On the segment R[0]R[1] the point B is drawn such that R[0]B/R[0]R[1]=t
for the same value of t.The Bézier curve defined by the points P[0], P[1],
P[2], P[3] is the locus of B as Q[0] takes all possible positions on the
segment P[0]P[1]. (Please note that for all points the value of t is the
same.)

In the applet to the right you can drag the points P[0], P[1], P[2] and
P[3] to see what the Bézier curve (green curve) defined by those points
looks like. You can also drag the point Q[0] along the segment P[0]P[1].

**NOTE: The applet is currently unavailable**

From the construction it is clear that the Bézier curve will be tangent to
the segments P[0]P[1] in P[0] and P[2]P[3] in P[3].

A cubic Bézier curve with P[0]=(1,0), P[1]=(1,v), P[2]=(v,1) and
P[3]=(0,1) is used to approximate a quarter circle.
The value v>0 is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines OP[0],
OP[3] and the curve is equal to ^π/[4] (the area of the quarter circle).

By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of
the quarter circle?
That is, if L is the length of the curve, calculate 100*^(L-π/2)/[(π/2)].

Problem 366
===========

Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.

There is one pile of n stones.

The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the
whole pile.

Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones his
opponent took on the previous move.
The player who removes the last stone wins.

E.g. n=5
If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player
will be able to take all remaining stones.
If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will take
also one stone, leaving three stones.
The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most 2x1=2
stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second player
can take the two remaining stones and wins.
So 5 is a losing position for the first player.
For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the
first player.
E.g. when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.

Let M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a
winning position at his first turn and M(n)=0 for any other position.

∑M(n) for n≤100 is 728.

Find ∑M(n) for n≤10^18.Give your answer modulo 10^8.

Problem 367
===========

Bozo sort, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient bogo sort,
consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not
swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the
sequence is sorted.

If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input
the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all 4! input
sequences is 24.75.
The already sorted sequence takes 0 steps.

In this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.
If the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and
shuffle these three elements randomly.
All 3!=6 permutations of those three elements are equally likely.
The already sorted sequence will take 0 steps.
If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input
the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all 4!
input sequences is 27.5.
Consider as input sequences the permutations of the first 11 natural
numbers.
Averaged over all 11! input sequences, what is the expected number of
shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform?

The harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... is well known to be divergent.

If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a
9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately
22.9206766193.
This modified harmonic series is called the Kempner series.

Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the
harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal
consecutive digits.One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the
harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.
These 20 omitted terms are: 1/111, 1/222, 1/333, 1/444, 1/555, 1/666, 1/777, 1/888, 1/999, 1/1000, 1/1110, 1/1111, 1/1112, 1/1113, 1/1114, 1/1115, 1/1116, 1/1117, 1/1118, and 1/1119.

   Die A: 1 4 4 4 4 4
   Die B: 2 2 2 5 5 5
   Die C: 3 3 3 3 3 6

   A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The
   player who rolls the highest value wins.

   If the first player picks die A and the second player picks die B we get
   P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2

   If the first player picks die B and the second player picks die C we get
   P(second player wins) = 7/12 > 1/2

   If the first player picks die C and the second player picks die A we get
   P(second player wins) = 25/36 > 1/2

   So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another
   die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning.
   A set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.

   We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will
   assume the following conditions:

     • There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and N
       pips, inclusive.
     • Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on
       the die the pips are located.
     • The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll
       the same value neither player wins.
     • The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.

   For N = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.

Problem 382
===========


   A polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight line segments that are
   joined to form a closed chain or circuit. A polygon consists of at least
   three sides and does not self-intersect.

   A set S of positive numbers is said to generate a polygon P if:

     • no two sides of P are the same length,
     • the length of every side of P is in S, and
     • S contains no other value.

   For example:
   The set {3, 4, 5} generates a polygon with sides 3, 4, and 5 (a triangle).
   The set {6, 9, 11, 24} generates a polygon with sides 6, 9, 11, and 24 (a
   quadrilateral).
   The sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4, 9} do not generate any polygon at all.

   Consider the sequence s, defined as follows:

     • s[1] = 1, s[2] = 2, s[3] = 3
     • s[n] = s[n-1] + s[n-3] for n > 3.

   Let U[n] be the set {s[1], s[2], ..., s[n]}. For example, U[10] = {1, 2,
   3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, 28, 41}.
   Let f(n) be the number of subsets of U[n] which generate at least one
   polygon.
   For example, f(5) = 7, f(10) = 501 and f(25) = 18635853.

   Define the sequence a(n) as the number of adjacent pairs of ones in the

   E.g.: a(5) = a(101[2]) = 0, a(6) = a(110[2]) = 1, a(7) = a(111[2]) = 2

   Define the sequence b(n) = (-1)^a(n).
   This sequence is called the Rudin-Shapiro sequence.

   Also consider the summatory sequence of b(n): .

   The first couple of values of these sequences are:
   n        0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
   a(n)     0     0     0     1     0     0     1     2

   s(n)     1     2     3     2     3     4     3     4

   The sequence s(n) has the remarkable property that all elements are
   positive and every positive integer k occurs exactly k times.

   Define g(t,c), with 1 ≤ c ≤ t, as the index in s(n) for which t occurs for
   the c'th time in s(n).
   E.g.: g(3,3) = 6, g(4,2) = 7 and g(54321,12345) = 1220847710.

   Let F(n) be the fibonacci sequence defined by:

   For any triangle T in the plane, it can be shown that there is a unique
   ellipse with largest area that is completely inside T.

   For a given n, consider triangles T such that:
   - the vertices of T have integer coordinates with absolute value ≤ n, and
   - the foci^1 of the largest-area ellipse inside T are (√13,0) and
   (-√13,0).
   Let A(n) be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.

   For example, if n = 8, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are
   (-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0) and (4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0), and the area of each
   triangle is 36. Thus A(8) = 36 + 36 = 72.

   It can be verified that A(10) = 252, A(100) = 34632 and A(1000) = 3529008.

   201 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by 3 (the sum of its

   When we truncate the last digit from 201, we get 20, which is a Harshad
   number.
   When we truncate the last digit from 20, we get 2, which is also a Harshad
   number.
   Let's call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the last
   digit, always results in a Harshad number a right truncatable Harshad
   number.

   Also:

   Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits,
   results in a prime a strong Harshad number.

   Now take the number 2011 which is prime.
   When we truncate the last digit from it we get 201, a strong Harshad
   number that is also right truncatable.
   Let's call such primes strong, right truncatable Harshad primes.

Problem 391
===========


   Let s[k] be the number of 1’s when writing the numbers from 0 to k in
   binary.
   For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101.
   There are seven 1’s, so s[5] = 7.
   The sequence S = {s[k] : k ≥ 0} starts {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, ...}.

   A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number n is
   chosen. A counter c starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses a number
   from 1 to n (inclusive) and increases c by that number. The resulting
   value of c must be a member of S. If there are no more valid moves, the
   player loses.

   For example:
   Let n = 5. c starts at 0.
   Player 1 chooses 4, so c becomes 0 + 4 = 4.
   Player 2 chooses 5, so c becomes 4 + 5 = 9.
   Player 1 chooses 3, so c becomes 9 + 3 = 12.
   etc.
   Note that c must always belong to S, and each player can increase c by at
   most n.

   Let M(n) be the highest number the first player can choose at her first
   turn to force a win, and M(n) = 0 if there is no such move. For example,
   M(2) = 2, M(7) = 1 and M(20) = 4.

   Given Σ(M(n))^3 = 8150 for 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

   Find Σ(M(n))^3 for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.

   The pie is circular. He starts with slicing an initial cut in the pie

   following procedure:
   - He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is
   remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally
   likely. This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces.
   - Going counterclockwise from the initial cut, he takes the first two pie

The Pythagorean tree is a fractal generated by the following procedure:

Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in the

1. Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the
   hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5
   ratio. Note that the smaller side of the triangle must be on the
   'right' side with respect to the base (see animation).
2. Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its

   The sequence terminates when g[k] becomes 0.

   For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}:

     • g[1] = 6.
     • g[2] = 11 since 6 = 110[2], 110[3] = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11.

Problem 406
===========


   We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
   {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. Each number (question) we ask, we get
   one of three possible answers:

     • "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
       a), or
     • "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of
       b), or
     • "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).

   Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total
   cost for the worst possible case.

   For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking "2"
   as our first question.

   If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
   b=3), then we are sure that "1" is the hidden number (for a total cost of
   3).
   If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2),
   then our next question will be "4".
   If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
   b=3), then we are sure that "3" is the hidden number (for a total cost of
   2+3=5).
   If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2),
   then we are sure that "5" is the hidden number (for a total cost of
   2+2=4).
   Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be
   shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. So, in
   fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of
   n, a, and b.

   Let C(n, a, b) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for
   the given values of n, a, and b.

   Here are a few examples:
   C(5, 2, 3) = 5
   C(500, √2, √3) = 13.22073197...
   C(20000, 5, 7) = 82
   C(2000000, √5, √7) = 49.63755955...

   Let F[k] be the Fibonacci numbers: F[k] = F[k-1] + F[k-2] with base cases
   F[1] = F[2] = 1.
   Find ∑[1≤k≤30] C(10^12, √k, √F[k]), and give your answer rounded to 8
   decimal places behind the decimal point.

   Let C be the circle with radius r, x^2 + y^2 = r^2. We choose two points
   P(a, b) and Q(-a, c) so that the line passing through P and Q is tangent

   Let n be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the coordinates
   (x, y) = (2^i mod n, 3^i mod n) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2n. We will consider stations
   with the same coordinates as the same station.

   We wish to form a path from (0, 0) to (n, n) such that the x and y
   coordinates never decrease.
   Let S(n) be the maximum number of stations such a path can pass through.

   For example, if n = 22, there are 11 distinct stations, and a valid path
   can pass through at most 5 stations. Therefore, S(22) = 5.The case is
   illustrated below, with an example of an optimal path:

   It can also be verified that S(123) = 14 and S(10000) = 48.

   For integers m, n (0 ≤ n < m), let L(m, n) be an m×m grid with the
   top-right n×n grid removed.

Problem 413
===========


   We say that a d-digit positive number (no leading zeros) is a one-child
   number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by d.

   For example, 5671 is a 4-digit one-child number. Among all its sub-strings
   5, 6, 7, 1, 56, 67, 71, 567, 671 and 5671, only 56 is divisible by 4.
   Similarly, 104 is a 3-digit one-child number because only 0 is divisible
   by 3.
   1132451 is a 7-digit one-child number because only 245 is divisible by 7.

   Let F(N) be the number of the one-child numbers less than N.
   We can verify that F(10) = 9, F(10^3) = 389 and F(10^7) = 277674.

Problem 414
===========


   6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and
   subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in
   decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.
   Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and
   repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up
   with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal.
   This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the
   number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.
   E.g. let's start with the number 0837:
   8730-0378=8352
   8532-2358=6174

   6174 is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and
   subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is
   reached is called the Kaprekar routine.

   We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.
   Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all
   cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or
   the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input
   numbers.
   However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3≠9, a
   Kaprekar constant exists.
   E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)[15]
   base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)[21]

   Define C[b] to be the Kaprekar constant in base b for 5 digits.Define the
   function sb(i) to be

     • 0 if i = C[b] or if i written in base b consists of 5 identical digits
     • the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base b to
       arrive at C[b], otherwise

   Note that we can define sb(i) for all integers i < b^5. If i written in
   base b takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero
   digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.

   Define S(b) as the sum of sb(i) for 0 < i < b^5.
   E.g. S(15) = 5274369
   S(111) = 400668930299

   Find the sum of S(6k+3) for 2 ≤ k ≤ 300.

Problem 415
===========


   A set of lattice points S is called a titanic set if there exists a line
   passing through exactly two points in S.

   An example of a titanic set is S = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2,
   0), (1, 0)}, where the line passing through (0, 1) and (2, 0) does not
   pass through any other point in S.

   On the other hand, the set {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)} is not a
   titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the set also
   passes through the other two.

   For any positive integer N, let T(N) be the number of titanic sets S whose
   every point (x, y) satisfies 0 ≤ x, y ≤ N.It can be verified that T(1) =
   11, T(2) = 494, T(4) = 33554178, T(111) mod 10^8 = 13500401 and
   T(10^5) mod 10^8 = 63259062.

Problem 416
===========


   A row of n squares contains a frog in the leftmost square. By successive
   jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then back to the leftmost
   square. On the outward trip he jumps one, two or three squares to the
   right, and on the homeward trip he jumps to the left in a similar manner.
   He cannot jump outside the squares. He repeats the round-trip travel m
   times.

   Let F(m, n) be the number of the ways the frog can travel so that at most
   one square remains unvisited.
   For example, F(1, 3) = 4, F(1, 4) = 15, F(1, 5) = 46, F(2, 3) = 16 and
   F(2, 100) mod 10^9 = 429619151.

   A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of
   the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

     1/3  =  0.(3)
     1/4  =  0.25
     1/5  =  0.2
     1/6  =  0.1(6)
     1/7  =  0.(142857)
     1/8  =  0.125
     1/9  =  0.(1)
     1/10 =  0.1

   Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can
   be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

   Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or
   5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
   We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0.

   Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n.You are given

Problem 424
===========

The above is an example of a cryptic kakuro (also known as cross sums, or
even sums cross) puzzle, with its final solution on the right. (The common
rules of kakuro puzzles can be found easily on numerous internet sites.
Other related information can also be currently found at [krazydad.com](http://krazydad.com)
whose author has provided the puzzle data for this challenge.)

The downloadable text file ([kakuro200.txt](files/kakuro200.txt)) contains the description of
200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first puzzle in the file
is the above example which is coded as follows:

6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X

The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the
information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7
(for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left
column are needed to insert information.

The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going
left to right and starting with the top line.
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its
equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a
lower case "h" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case "v". Those
are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a
single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter
would be for the "tens" and the second one for the "units". When the cell
must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the
first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a
comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets
is also immediately followed by a comma.

The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line
Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.

The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter
necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical
order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. 
At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of
the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must be
assigned the remaining digit.

You are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in the
file is 64414157580.

   Two positive numbers A and B are said to be connected (denoted by "A ↔ B")
   if one of these conditions holds:
   (1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for
   example, 123 ↔ 173.
   (2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example,
   23 ↔ 223 and 123 ↔ 23.

   We call a prime P a 2's relative if there exists a chain of connected
   primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.

   For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown
   below:
   2 ↔ 3 ↔ 13 ↔ 113 ↔ 103 ↔ 107 ↔ 127
   However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.

   Let F(N) be the sum of the primes ≤ N which are not 2's relatives.
   We can verify that F(10^3) = 431 and F(10^4) = 78728.

   Find F(10^7).

Problem 426
===========


Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For
example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed
by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can
be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of
consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.

A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the
following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the
nearest empty box to its right.

After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can
be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first
occupied box.

![](files/p_426_baxball1.gif)

A system like this is called a Box-Ball System or BBS for short.

It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system
evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is
invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes
evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.

![](files/p_426_baxball2.gif)

We define the sequence {t[i]}:

 • s[0] = 290797
 • s[k+1] = s[k]^2 mod 50515093
 • t[k] = (s[k] mod 64) + 1

Starting from the initial configuration (t[0], t[1], …, t[10]), the final
state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].
Starting from the initial configuration (t[0], t[1], …, t[10 000 000]),
find the final state.
Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final
state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 1^2 + 2^2
+ 3^2) is your answer.

Problem 427
===========


   A sequence of integers S = {s[i]} is called an n-sequence if it has n
   elements and each element s[i] satisfies 1 ≤ s[i] ≤ n. Thus there are n^n
   distinct n-sequences in total.For example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10,
   7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a 10-sequence.

   For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous
   subsequence of S with the same value.For example, for the given sequence S
   above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7's.

   Let f(n) = ∑ L(S) for all n-sequences S.

   For example, f(3) = 45, f(7) = 1403689 and f(11) = 481496895121.

   Let C[in] be the circle having the diameter XY.
   Let C[out] be the circle having the diameter WZ.

   The triplet (a, b, c) is called a necklace triplet if you can place k ≥ 3

N disks are placed in a row, indexed 1 to N from left to right.
Each disk has a black side and white side. Initially all disks show their
white side.

At each turn, two, not necessarily distinct, integers A and B between 1
and N (inclusive) are chosen uniformly at random.
All disks with an index from A to B (inclusive) are flipped.

The following example shows the case N = 8. At the first turn A = 5 and B
= 2, and at the second turn A = 4 and B = 6.

Problem 431
===========

Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm
and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated
when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from
the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture
cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base.
Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.

Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered
from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the
horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of
repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the
silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the
case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted
would be approximately 32.648388556 m^3. However, if grain is delivered at
a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the
centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He
shows Fred a picture.

![](files/p_431_grain_silo.png)

We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by
$V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal
places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx 36$.
Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one
other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like knowing that
the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your
grain.

Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on
closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness
turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the
radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of
repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of
solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep
it.

If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the
farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$
for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$
correct to 9 decimal places.

Problem 434
===========


   Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the
   vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.
   Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with
   a point in the Euclidean space.
   A flexible graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move
   one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least
   two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair
   of adjacent vertices is kept constant.
   A rigid graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
   Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully
   rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic,
   no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the
   graph.

   The grid graphs embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the
   following animation demonstrates:

   However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells.
   For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph
   rigid:

   Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing
   the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell
   as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.

   Let R(m,n) be the number of ways to make the m × n grid graph rigid.
   E.g. R(2,3) = 19 and R(5,5) = 23679901

   Define S(N) as ∑R(i,j) for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N.

   The game starts with S = 0.
   The first player, Louise, adds to S different random numbers from the

   When we calculate 8^n modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3,
   2, 5, 7.
   As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a primitive root
   of 11.
   But there is more:
   If we take a closer look we see:
   1+8=9
   8+9=17≡6 mod 11
   9+6=15≡4 mod 11
   6+4=10
   4+10=14≡3 mod 11
   10+3=13≡2 mod 11
   3+2=5
   2+5=7
   5+7=12≡1 mod 11.

   So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8^n + 8^n+1 ≡
   8^n+2 (mod 11).
   8 is called a Fibonacci primitive root of 11.
   Not every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.

   A group of p people decide to sit down at a round table and play a

   with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for each person to
   maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.

   An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the
   table, each player has only one of two options:

   1. The player can scratch his ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at
   the table.
   2. The player can trade his unscratched ticket for a previous player's
   scratched ticket, and then leave the game with that ticket. The previous
   player then scratches his newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to
   everyone at the table.

   The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still
   remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.

   A hypocycloid is the curve drawn by a point on a small circle rolling
   inside a larger circle. The parametric equations of a hypocycloid centered
   at the origin, and starting at the right most point is given by:

              $x(t) = (R - r) \cos(t) + r \cos(\frac {R - r} r t)$
              $y(t) = (R - r) \sin(t) - r \sin(\frac {R - r} r t)$

   Where R is the radius of the large circle and r the radius of the small
   circle.

   Let $C(R, r)$ be the set of distinct points with integer coordinates on
   the hypocycloid with radius R and r and for which there is a corresponding
   value of t such that $\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$ are rational numbers.

Problem 460
===========


   On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point A(0, 1) to point B(d, 1)
   for an integer d.

   In each step, the ant at point (x[0], y[0]) chooses one of the lattice
   points (x[1], y[1]) which satisfy x[1] ≥ 0 and y[1] ≥ 1 and goes straight
   to (x[1], y[1]) at a constant velocity v. The value of v depends on y[0]
   and y[1] as follows:

     • If y[0] = y[1], the value of v equals y[0].
     • If y[0] ≠ y[1], the value of v equals (y[1] - y[0]) / (ln(y[1]) -
       ln(y[0])).

   The left image is one of the possible paths for d = 4. First the ant goes
   from A(0, 1) to P[1](1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1)) ≈ 1.8205.
   Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.
   From P[1](1, 3) to P[2](3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the
   required time is 2 / 3 ≈ 0.6667. From P[2](3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant
   travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) ≈ 1.8205 so the required
   time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.
   Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.

   The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as
   0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest
   path for d = 4.

   Let F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path.
   For example, F(4) ≈ 2.960516287.
   We can verify that F(10) ≈ 4.668187834 and F(100) ≈ 9.217221972.

   The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the
   entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a
   polygon for which the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.

   For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices.
   However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have
   zero area.

   For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the
   kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the
   origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):

   Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.

   Let P(n) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (x, y)
   have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than n.

   Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different
   set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon
   with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with
   vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].

Problem 470
===========


   Consider a single game of Ramvok:

   Let t represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If t = 0, then
   the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn i, the player rolls a
   die. After rolling, if i < t the player can either stop the game and
   receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the
   roll and try again next turn. If i = t, then the roll cannot be discarded
   and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, t is chosen by the
   player, who must then pay an up-front cost ct for some constant c. For c =
   0, t can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(d,
   c) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a
   single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die and cost
   constant c. For example, R(4, 0.2) = 2.65. Assume that the player has
   sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.

   Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:

   In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a
   slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration
   process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face
   has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If
   the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value.
   After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during
   such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on
   it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at
   all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are
   blank.

   Let S(d, c) be the expected profit that the player receives from an
   optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die to start
   (with all sides visible), and cost constant c. For example, S(6, 1) =
   208.3.

   Let F(n) = ∑[4≤d≤n] ∑[0≤c≤n] S(d, c).

   Calculate F(20), rounded to the nearest integer.

Problem 472
===========


   There are N seats in a row. N people come one after another to fill the
   seats according to the following rules:

    1. No person sits beside another.
    2. The first person chooses any seat.
    3. Each subsequent person chooses the seat furthest from anyone else
       already seated, as long as it does not violate rule 1. If there is
       more than one choice satisfying this condition, then the person
       chooses the leftmost choice.

   Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied, and
   the maximum number of people that can be seated is less than N (for N >
   1).

   Here are the possible seating arrangements for N = 15:

   We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the 15 seats can seat
   up to 7 people.
   We can also see that the first person has 9 choices to maximize the number
   of people that may be seated.

   Let f(N) be the number of choices the first person has to maximize the
   number of occupants for N seats in a row. Thus, f(1) = 1, f(15) = 9,
   f(20) = 6, and f(500) = 16.

   Also, ∑f(N) = 83 for 1 ≤ N ≤ 20 and ∑f(N) = 13343 for 1 ≤ N ≤ 500.

   Find ∑f(N) for 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12. Give the last 8 digits of your answer.

Problem 473
===========


   Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$
   Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of
   powers of $\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\varphi$ is
   used at most once in this sum.
   Even then this representation is not unique.
   We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive
   exponents are used and that the representation is finite.
   E.g: $2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$

   To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and
   1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.
   We call this the representation in the phigital numberbase.
   So $1=1_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\varphi}$ and
   $14=100100.001001_{\varphi}$.
   The strings representing 1, 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are
   palindromic, while the string representating 3 is not.
   (the phigital point is not the middle character).

   The sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1000 whose phigital
   representation is palindromic is 4345.

   Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose
   phigital representation is palindromic.

Problem 477
===========
    

The number sequence game starts with a sequence _S_ of _N_ numbers written on a line.

Two players alternate turns. At his turn, a player must select and remove either the first or the last number remaining in the sequence.

The player score is the sum of all the numbers he has taken. Each player attempts to maximize his own sum.

If _N_ = 4 and _S_ = {1, 2, 10, 3}, then each player maximizes his score as follows:
Player 1: removes the first number (1)
Player 2: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (3)
Player 1: removes the last number from the remaining sequence (10)
Player 2: removes the remaining number (2)
Player 1 score is 1 + 10 = 11.

Let _F(N)_ be the score of player 1 if both players follow the optimal strategy for the sequence S = {s1, s2, ..., sN} defined as:

s1 = 0
si+1 = (si^2 + 45) modulo 1 000 000 007
The sequence begins with _S_ = {0, 45, 2070, 4284945, 753524550, 478107844, 894218625, ...}.

You are given F(2) = 45, F(4) = 4284990, F(100) = 26365463243, F(10^4) = 2495838522951.

Problem 478
===========


Let us consider mixtures of three substances: A, B and C. A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of A, B, and C in it, i.e., `(a : b : c)`. For example, a mixture described by the ratio `(2 : 3 : 5)` contains 20% A, 30% B and 50% C.

For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.

For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios `(3 : 0 : 2)`, `(3 : 6 : 11)` and `(3 : 3 : 4)`. By mixing 10 units of the first, 20 units of the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio `(6 : 5 : 9)`, since:
```
(10·3/5 + 20·3/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·0/5 + 20·6/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·2/5 + 20·11/20 + 30·4/10) = (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)
```
However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio `(3 : 2 : 1)`, since the amount of B is always less than the amount of C.

Let _n_ be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers `(a, b, c)` with `0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n` and `gcd(a, b, c) = 1`, we have a mixture with ratio `(a : b : c)`. Let M(_n_) be the set of all such mixtures.

For example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios:
```
{(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 1 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2), (0 : 2 : 1), 
(1 : 0 : 0), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 2), (1 : 1 : 0), (1 : 1 : 1), 
(1 : 1 : 2), (1 : 2 : 0), (1 : 2 : 1), (1 : 2 : 2), (2 : 0 : 1), 
(2 : 1 : 0), (2 : 1 : 1), (2 : 1 : 2), (2 : 2 : 1)}.
```

Let E(_n_) be the number of subsets of M(_n_) which can produce the mixture with ratio `(1 : 1 : 1)`, i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C. 
We can verify that `E(1) = 103`, `E(2) = 520447`, `E(10) mod 118 = 82608406` and `E(500) mod 11^8 = 13801403`.
Find `E(10 000 000) mod 11^8`.
